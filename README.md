# üöÄ 30 Days of Projects: Learning Python, Go, and Ruby
In this repository, I embark on a learning journey to gain proficiency in three programming languages: Python, Go (also known as Golang), and Ruby.

## üìù Purpose
The main objective of this challenge is to learn through building practical projects. While I had some prior knowledge of Python, Go and Ruby are entirely new to me. I'm using these projects as personal training, allowing me to explore the unique features, syntax, and capabilities of each language.

## üìÖ Itinerary
Here's the list of projects I plan to complete over the next 30 days:

- Hello World: Introduction to the world of programming by displaying "Hello, World!".
- Calculator: A functional calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
- Guess the Number: A game where you try to guess a randomly generated number.
- Stopwatch: Measure time intervals with precision.
- Unit Converter: Convert between various units across different categories.
- Note Taking App: Create and manage personal notes.
